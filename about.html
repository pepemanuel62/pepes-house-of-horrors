                    <p>Flexbox page you just left. He said we could link to wherever we wanted so...Here you are!! Not gonna mess too much with this page</p>
                    <p>tho till I have time to lay it out all nice n slick like instead of on the fly like the rest of my site here. Still learning and want one nice</p>
                    <p>page before I go back and fix the other pages. I thought this one could be more than just an About page and make it sorta like a blog</p>
                    <p>where I keep track of my progress on my coding journey. So, thanks for reading and check back often for updates! Shadilay, my fren!</p>

                    <h2>Sun, 3/30/25</h2>
                    <p>Been a minute since I've added anything here so today seemed like as good a time as any. The whole sight needs to be cleaned up. The</p>
                    <p>codes a mess lol. It's that way because when I started a month ago I was brand spanking new to web developement and excited to</p>
                    <p>just have something to look at online. Anyway, today I'm gonna focus on making a nice looking navbar to be at the top of each page</p>
                    <p>like it's supposed to be lol. It's early morning so check back later today and hopefully I'll have er done. Still not much "about" me</p>
                    <p>yet but it's coming!</p>
                </div>

                    <h2>Sat, 4/12/25</h2>
                    <p>Not spent any time messing with the site. Been spending most all my time learning JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>It's hard :(</p>
                    <p>I did make the navbar. Did that the same day as last entry here. That was easy compared to learning JS.</p>
                    <p>Came on just to add a script on the box model page because I just learned the JS parseInt function which</p>
                    <p>I thought was kinda cool. Check it out.</p>
                    <p>Uh oh! lol Wanted to give the page a little margin left n right so without working on the entire site's</p>
                    <p>CSS, which would take some time, thought I'd just create a seperate stylesheet file for just this page</p>
                    <p>and well, guess what that did? ha Not fixing it now. Deal with it.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>much later in the day 4/12/25</h2>
                    <p>Just so you know I'm not always a clown, I'd like to share a project I'm working on. It's a simple webpage</p>
                    <p>right now that I created a week ago but would like to make it a full blown web app maybe even a mobile app</p>
                    <p>but that's not anytime soon. Still have a LOT to learn! Anyway, check it out. It's called Selah. Link below:</p>
